Python Socket Programming for Python3


Basics of Sockets

Sockets are opened and closed to aid in communication between two entities
  Server and Client
  Requesting information
  Ports
  Port 80 used to transfer http data
    Websites

import socket

to create socket:
  s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.sock_STREAM)
  sock.STREAM is used for TCP

communicate with Socket
  server = 'youtube.com'
  port = __ (80) for Websites

server_ip = socket.gethostbyname(server)

request = "GET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: "+server+"\n\n"
  making http Request
s.connect((server,port))
s.send(request.encode())
results = s.recv(4096)
  this is the buffer

while (len(result) > 0):
  print(result)
  result = s.recv(4096)

simple port scanner tells whether ports are open or closed

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.sock_STREAM)
server = "youtube.com"

def pscan(port):
  try:
    s.connect((server,port))
    return TRUE
  except:
    return FALSE

for x in range(1,26):
    if pscan(x):
        print('Port',x,'is open')
    else:
      print('Port',x,'is closed')
